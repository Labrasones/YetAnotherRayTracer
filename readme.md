# Yet Another Ray Tracer
#### Yes, it's nothing new and fancy. No, I don't intend it to be. However, even fundamentals can teach a great deal

With the guidence of [Scratchapixel's in depth ray tracing tutorials](http://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php), 
this simple ray tracing application is an engaging and interesting way to build all kinds of skills and
experience with C++

Credit where credit is due. Because this project leans heavily on Scratchapixel's tutorials, much of
the codebase will closely replicate code provided by the author of Scratchapixel. However, this project
does not follow the structure of Scratchapixel. The focus of this project _is_ the modifications that
need to be made to allow for a different structure.
